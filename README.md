# Member_Referrals_Analysis_and_Insights
The below notebook contains the different insights from two different csv files containing different data of Customers and some logs. 

It tries to find answers for below questions :  
1. When do members refer?  
2. Does the channel members are acquired from significantly impact how they refer?  
3. We can send an email to members to invite them to refer their friends. When and to which target group should we send it?  
4. Does the data suggest that the referral behaviour of members changes over time? 
5. What trends, if any, do you expect going forward? How would you measure these?  

Along with this, my main goal is to find from the above insights that, what all steps needs to be taken to increase the sign-ups via the 
'Referral' sign-up channel.
